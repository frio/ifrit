# Ifrit

Ifrit is intended to eventually be a framework/library (what's the difference?) for building an ifttt-clone, in the style of XMonad (where the configuration file is actually Haskell code in its own rite).

The initial proof-of-concept which I hope to hack out shortly should monitor syslog, and send pushover alerts when my VPN gets logged into.

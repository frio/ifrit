# Ifrit

Ifrit is intended to eventually be a framework/library for building an ifttt-clone, in the style of XMonad (where the configuration file is actually Haskell code in its own right).

The initial proof-of-concept which I hope to hack out shortly should monitor syslog, and send pushover alerts when my VPN gets logged into.

## Development

The use of hsenv and Guard is recommended.

## ... Dead

Since starting this project, I've switched platforms to using Elixir and the Erlang OTP.  Source to be published shortly!
